#functions-print, len, etc...
#why do we run functions- help divide code into well isolated pieces
#organize code so it's easier to read and maintain later on
#well defined and well made functions
#no more duplication- call the function over and over instead of duplcating code
#fnction starts with def followed by round brackets and colen
#function body, need an indented instruction that is invoked every time
